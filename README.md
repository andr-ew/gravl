# grvl

dual data pavement.

a spiritual successor to [anaphora](https://github.com/andr-ew/prosody#anaphora) & [dirge](https://github.com/andr-ew/prosody#dirge).

a digital tape machine â€“ joyfully abandoning transparency. recorded sound is treated as raw, unadulterated data (like loose sediment), subjected to multiple layers of erosion in the time & amplitude domains, clicks & all. you might hate it.

currently in beta - any & all feedback is highly appreciated! feel free to create an issue here or send me an email andrewcshike@gmail.com :) (email is usually the best way to reach me). if you're running into trouble, be sure to check out the [issues](https://github.com/andr-ew/grvl/issues) section to see if your issue has already been logged ~
